Sadly, the server seems to demolish itself after the first few entries. At least that is what I have been experiencing the last ~20 installations. I will EOL this repo until I have time to look further into it. Although I am probably going to write a plugin for MediaWiki or DokuWiki because the wiki.js developer didn't seem to care to implement unit tests (as far as I can see). You may resolve this issue by inserting a link to a new release into the post install file.

# iocage-plugin-wikijs
[Wiki.js](https://github.com/Requarks/wiki) as an unofficial TrueNAS plugin

## Not working
- The server is not able to send eMails at the moment
